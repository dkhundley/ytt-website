                <h2>What to Expect</h2>
                <div class="what-to-expect-content">
                    <p>My practice teaching sessions are designed to be accessible, welcoming, and supportive for everyoneâ€”especially if you're newer to yoga. You can expect a calm and encouraging environment where there's no pressure to be perfect.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each class runs for 60 minutes and follows a power yoga format, weaving in themes like mindfulness, breath, and presence. I'll guide you with clear, easy-to-follow cues, and I'll always offer modifications so you can move at a pace and level that works for you.</p>
                    
                    <p>Please bring a yoga mat if you have one (though I do have a few extras to borrow), a water bottle, and a towel. If you don't have a mat, a large beach towel will also do just fine.</p>
                    
                    <p>If we are meeting at Yoga Lab, you'll need to sign their liability waiver through Momence. I'll provide all the details when you sign up.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do I need to be experienced with yoga?</h3>
                        <p>Nope! If you have never practiced yoga before, I will offer cues along the way to help you throughout the practice. Additionally, you'll find that many of the cues repeat, so as the class goes on, you'll likely find yourself starting to get the hang of things easily.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
                        <p>Anything that you feel comfortable moving around in. Any athletic wear is totally fine. I would personally steer clear of stiff clothes like jeans. (And be aware that you likely will sweat anyway!)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I bring a friend?</h3>
                        <p>Yes please, I would encourage it! The more, the merrier!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How difficult is power yoga?</h3>
                        <p>I like to think of power yoga as a blend between yoga as you might traditionally know it and a cardio class like HIIT. It is challenging, but the encouragement here is that you take what you need on your mat. Throughout the class, I will offer modifications to various poses to help make the experience a fulfilling one for you.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What if I don't have a mat?</h3>
                        <p>I have around 3-4 extra mats that people can borrow, and I'd be glad to have those cleaned if you would like to use one. Now, if you plan to roll up with a crew of 5+ people who all need mats, I unfortunately won't be able to provide a mat for everybody. But you don't necessarily need a formal mat! A large beach towel would also be okay.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Are the practice teaching courses directly sponsored by Yoga Lab?</h3>
                        <p>No. While I took my yoga teacher training through Yoga Lab and will host a few classes at their facility, my practice classes are not directly sponsored by Yoga Lab.</p>
