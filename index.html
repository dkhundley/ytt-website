                <div class="what-to-expect-content">
                    <p>My practice teaching sessions are designed to be accessible, welcoming, and supportive for everyone—especially if you're newer to yoga. You can expect a calm and encouraging environment where there's no pressure to be perfect.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each class runs for 60 minutes and follows a power yoga format, weaving in themes like mindfulness, breath, and presence. I'll guide you with clear, easy-to-follow cues, and I'll always offer modifications so you can move at a pace and level that works for you.</p>
                    
                    <p>All classes are held at Yoga Lab, where I completed my yoga teacher training. Please bring a water bottle, towel, and your own yoga mat if you have one. If you don't have a mat, no worries—one can be provided for you at the studio.</p>
                    
                    <p>You'll need to sign Yoga Lab's liability waiver through Momence when you book your class. I'll provide all the details when you sign up.</p>

                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>Having been a runner for the last 10 years, I was looking for something more sustainable given that I've been having knee and foot related injuries from running on a daily basis. My wife, Maggie, is a yoga teacher at Yoga Lab, so I decided to give it a try about a year ago. I now attend typical classes at Yoga Lab on an almost daily basis. It has been a great addition to my life in a variety of ways. In addition to it being a good physical workout, I really appreciate the sense of community and accountability that practicing yoga with others provides. When this opportunity came open for yoga teacher training, I jumped on it to both deepen my own practice and also have a potential future for leading others in yoga practices. I have a deep appreciation for everybody and want to be able to help people in their own life's journey with the sustainability and regulation that yoga has provided me.</p>

                <div class="faq-list">
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do I need to be experienced with yoga?</h3>
                        <p>Nope! If you have never practiced yoga before, I will offer cues along the way to help you throughout the practice. Additionally, you'll find that many of the cues repeat, so as the class goes on, you'll likely find yourself starting to get the hang of things easily.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
                        <p>Anything that you feel comfortable moving around in. Any athletic wear is totally fine. I would personally steer clear of stiff clothes like jeans. (And be aware that you likely will sweat anyway!)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I bring a friend?</h3>
                        <p>Yes please, I would encourage it! The more, the merrier!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How difficult is power yoga?</h3>
                        <p>I like to think of power yoga as a blend between yoga as you might traditionally know it and a cardio class like HIIT. It is challenging, but the encouragement here is that you take what you need on your mat. Throughout the class, I will offer modifications to various poses to help make the experience a fulfilling one for you.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do I need a mat?</h3>
                        <p>No worries if you don't have your own mat! I have a few extra mats available, and Yoga Lab has kindly offered the use of their rental mats for our practice sessions. There are plenty of mats available for everyone who needs one.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Are the practice teaching courses directly sponsored by Yoga Lab?</h3>
                        <p>No. While I took my yoga teacher training through Yoga Lab and will host a few classes at their facility, my practice classes are not directly sponsored by Yoga Lab.</p>
